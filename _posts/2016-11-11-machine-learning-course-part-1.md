I just started the online Coursera course for [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/RKFpn/welcome) by Andrew Ng. For the past couple of years I waded through the big data world a bit. Now I am trying to understand a bit of machine learning. (Also this [page](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html) has lot of material).

What hit me was the broad scope of machine learning. So it is really exciting and interesting to start on this journey which will hopefully wake me up from my lazy technical hibernation.

The first interesting thing I see is that photo classification, mail classification, user segmentation of web searches are all ML problems. These involve processing lots of data.

This is followed by NLP, handwriting recognition, vision, autonomous helicopters etc where Ng claims it is not easy to write programs to do these. Not sure what he means by this. I guess there are so many axes along which you need to compare two things to be able to declare them as part of the same group. These axes may not be known beforehand or even if they are known, they may not have strict watermarks for comparisons. So a flexible machine generated model and corresponding code is better than a program with fixed dimensions and parameters.

There is another class of applications which are recommendation systems like Amazon or Netflix. These involve personalization and customization on a massive scale while still providing serendipity.

Overall I see there are specific problems where machine learning plays a big role in providing an elegant automated solution but the various kinds of machine learning are not very clear. Also the above classification seems a bit arbitrary, confusing and overlapping. Hoping things will get better as I make some progress.
