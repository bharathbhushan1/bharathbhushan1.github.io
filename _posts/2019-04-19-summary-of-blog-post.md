[Kyunghyun Cho](https://twitter.com/kchonyc) had written (in 2015) a [blog post](https://sites.google.com/site/deepernn/home/blog/briefsummaryofthepaneldiscussionatdlworkshopicml2015) titled _Brief Summary of the Panel Discussion at DL Workshop @ICML 2015_. I found the post interesting and below is a quick summary.

The panelists talked about the following topics as the future of deep learning.

* Deep learning for NLP
* Unsupervised learning
* Medical image analysis
* Drug discovery
* Q&A systems
* Sequential decision making
* DL for Non-cognitive tasks

Also there was some content about AI hype, General AI, academia vs industry etc.
