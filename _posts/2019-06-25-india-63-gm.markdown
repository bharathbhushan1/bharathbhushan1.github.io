Girish Koushik became Karnataka's 3rd and India's [63rd
GM](https://chessbase.in/news/Girih-Koushik-becomes-Indias-63rd-GM).
He just finished his B.E. in E&C and gained 56 ELO
points and the remaining 2 GM norms in a month. Amazing !

Increase in disposable income of the middle and lower middle classes seems to
be correlated with India's sports boom. This also showcases the aspirations of
Indians after a millenium of foreign rule.
