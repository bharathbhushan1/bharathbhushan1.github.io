* A new paper [Reinforcement Learning, Fast and Slow](https://twitter.com/DeepMindAI/status/1123979484485570566) from DeepMind reviews recent techniques and improvements in deep Reinforcement Learning. This paper talks about eposodic-RL, meta-RL and its combination.
* A [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1119-1) on technology that can translate neural activity into speech. Mind-blowing.
* Style transfer is such an interesting topic. The seminal [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) on this is from the [Bethge Lab](http://bethgelab.org) and is titled _A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style_. A summary article is [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/towards-fast-neural-style-transfer-191012b86284).
